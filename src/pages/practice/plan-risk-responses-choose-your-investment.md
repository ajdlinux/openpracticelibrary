whatIs: The Risk Response Planning step is where we decide what to do about the
  risks we have identified, ranked, and measured.
whyDo: Prioritization of work and risk responses.

   The risk strategy options generally available to us are:

  1. Avoidance – eliminate the cause of the risk

  2. Mitigation – reduce probability of the occurrence

  3. Transference – insurance, outsource, etc.

  4. Acceptance – accept and communicate to stakeholders


  A fifth “Denial” option is a widely practiced risk response approach, but is not a valid option. Generally, it is best to avoid risks by finding ways to eliminate the root cause of the risk. Failing that, make them smaller or pass them to a party who is better able to handle them (for instance, outsource that work to a specialist in that field). Finally, the least preferable option is to accept the risk. For example, perhaps we just need to wait for service pack 2 from the vendor to fix the issue and until then we accept the risk of performance slowdowns.


  We need to explain these options to the team and make sure they understand the order of preference and how the risk response options impact the residual risk to the project.


  Residual risk is the remaining risk to the project even after we have taken the best risk response option we are able to. Perhaps in our reporting performance example, we chose to run the reporting engine on a high-performance server. This helps somewhat, but we still have the residual risk that the higher spec machine is not sufficient.


  Secondary risks are new risks occurring as a result of our risk-response strategy. Maybe we decided to do the report processing on the company's new scalable cloud platform. This may sound like a good idea, but if the company cloud platform is new and untested, then maybe this secondary risk is more significant that the original one we were trying to avoid or reduce. So we need to quantify secondary risks to ensure they are indeed smaller than the risk we are responding to.


  Once the team is familiar with the concepts of risk-response options, residual risks, and secondary risks, we can engage them in the initial step of putting action items in the backlog. Backlog prioritization is a business/product owner role but they will need help determining the priority of risk response actions; this is where steps to normalize the risks and feature values are required.


  Not all risks can be avoided or reduced and we just reviewed how some risks might have to be accepted. When accepting a risk, there is no backlog action to create or balance against new functionality. However, if we can avoid a US$50,000 EMV risk, then this risk avoidance is worth US$50,000 to the project and should be inserted in the backlog above features worth US$49,000 to the business.


  We need to compare the value of risk response actions to the value of prioritized features and insert them in the appropriate place. When doing so, we also have to be aware of residual and secondary risks. So, the value of a risk response action = Net Monetary Value (EMV) = EMV of Residual Risk + EMV of Secondary Risk.


  For example, simply avoiding a risk with an EMV of US$40,000 that has no residual risks or secondary risks is worth US$40,000. Yet reducing the impact of a US$60,000 risk by trying an alternative approach that only addresses half of the problem and in itself carries a US$10,000 EMV is only worth US$60,000/2 = US$30,000 + US$10,000 = US$40,000.


  So, we need to normalize all the risk responses to values to take into account residual and secondary risks before asking product owners to prioritize these actions in the backlog.


  The Report Card is a list of recommended risk responses, normalized by net EMV, for consideration by the business representative/product owner. It is prioritized by Net EMV.


  With this information, the product owner can now discuss adding these risk response actions into the backlog.


  “Inoculator” is the name given to the process of injecting risk avoidance/mitigation and opportunity stories into the backlog. It is done by the product owner, but with consultation and guidance of the development team. It is this ability and frequent opportunity (every iteration planning meeting) to be able to reduce remaining risks and capitalize on opportunities that set agile methods apart from other, slower review cadence approaches that inspect and adapt less frequently.


  By avoiding and reducing risks closer to their identification, the horizon of risk that the project is exposed to shortens. By making changes earlier in the life cycle, the costs of changes are reduced. On the flip side, capitalizing on opportunities is like getting investments done early; they have longer to accumulate. These are the compounding benefits of early and rapid risk and opportunity management.


  Getting the risk response actions into the backlog is how these tasks are scheduled and undertaken. We want to make sure that all our risk management work is not supplemental to the project plan, but baked right in. All too often, risk management is an activity done upfront or alongside the project, but never really integrated into the day to day activities of the project.


  By inserting these new stories into the backlog, we drive risk management actions from the analysis to action.
