whatIs: This practice is a way to use gaming and visual cues to facilitate risk
  identification, categorization, and initial analysis with a team.
whyDo: A critical step in discovery is to identify potential risks and
  opportunities. Opportunities are the “good” risks or fortuitous events that
  have a positive impact should they occur. We want to avoid risks and exploit
  opportunities.
howTo: >-
  Using a clock view pre-drawn on a white board or flip chart we ask team
  members to think of project risks associated with each of the topics
  represented by an hour line on the clock — 12 in total.


  This is the doomsday part, we encourage the team members to think of and record as many risks as they can about that topic. We work topic by topic, but if thinking of risks triggers ideas in other areas as we progress, it is not unusual to get risks being added to previously discussed risk lines. Again, I prefer having people working individually for coming up with ideas. Then, we put them all on the wall and consolidate and remove duplicates as a group, which also sometimes identifies new risks.


  Discourage people's tendencies to want to score, rank, and solve the risks. This is risk identification, which we will have plenty of time to process later.


  A wall filled with risk sticky notes around every aspect of the project can seem like a discouraging prospect for some, but it is also a useful eye opener for why risk management is so important. This project is not magically going to work out all by itself. We have some real obstacles in front of us and we need to work as a team to overcome them.


  Always within the same session, I like to run the flip side exercise – “Karma Day.” In this exercise, we generate opportunities for events and outcomes that would assist the project. Generating ideas for things that would help the project go well. Using the same clock metaphor we come up with lists of all the good things that could occur to assist the project.


  Cynical team members may still continue to gripe, suggesting opportunities, “inverted issues” such as “Actually getting a 1- or 2-day turnaround on our database requests, for a change” or “support not resistance from the PMO,” but these can be really useful. Just as we later ask in risk management: “How do we avoid or reduce these risks” in opportunity management, we ask: “How do we ensure or maximize these opportunities?” If spending a couple of hours explaining the project goals and approach to supporting groups, or proactively asking them how we might best engage with them makes a difference, then this work could have a huge return on the time invested.


  Without asking the team for a list of all the good things that can happen, team leads and project managers will likely be unaware of all the ways in which they could serve and support the team. The Scrum master as an “obstacle remover” is a one-sided, glass-half-empty view of the world. Why not explicitly add “opportunity implementer” to the job description and let's see if we can arrange some mutual wins by being proactive.


  These techniques are facilitated games for identifying risks and opportunities, but they do not stop us from applying more conventional approaches too, such as risk profiles, project risk lists, SWOT analysis, retrospective findings, user story analysis, and so forth. Let's not throw out the baby with the bath water; we should still use traditional approaches, but augment them with team-based approaches for better insights and buy-in.
