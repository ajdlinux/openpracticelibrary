whatIs: The practice is a way to conduct initial analysis of risks and rank or
  prioritize them.
whyDo: After identifying risks and opportunities, we need to classify and rank
  them. Risks and opportunities need to be categorized and prioritized.
howTo: >-
  The traditional way of doing this is to assign numerical Probability and
  Impact scores using something like the matrix shown below. While
  mathematically valid, many people find it counter-intuitive that the highest
  ranked risks are grouped right next to the highest rank opportunities because
  they represent opposite extremes of bad and good outcomes for the project.


  Another issue with assigning estimated probability and impact values is that people are much better at relative estimation than absolute estimation. We get hung up on whether something has a 0.7 or 0.9 chance of happening, but could tell you that it is more likely that the lack of C+ experience will bite us before a lack of MSBuild experience will. This is one reason why many agile teams use effort estimation based on points rather than ideal days, and we give directions in reference to landmarks rather than pure distances. People are better at relative estimation than absolute estimation.


  So, recognizing these human traits, I prefer to get teams to gauge impacts and probabilities in a more intuitive and relative way. For this we use “Investors and Help Wanted” board concepts. Risks are things we need help with, opportunities and things we are seeking investors and supporters for. Using scales of impact to the project in terms of Impact (costs for risks) and (benefits for opportunities) on the X axis and Probability of occurrence on the Y axis the risks and opportunities can be visualized by the team.


  In this layout, the X axis of Impact to the project in terms of benefits and costs, creates a spread where the greatest opportunities are furthest removed from the greatest risks. We do not worry too much about numeric analysis of probabilities, but instead use relative ranking to determine the vertical positions. The benefits at this stage really come from the conversations among team members about analyzing the risks and opportunities and gaining consensus as to where they belong relative to each other on the charts.


  Visualizing and agreeing on a spatial reference for the risks and opportunities also engage the right hemisphere of the brain and makes us less likely to forget them. (Assigning things we want to remember to a location is a memory aid that many memory-improvement techniques use. Probably relating back to our hunter–gatherer days when our survival relied upon remembering where to find food and water, we have better recall of things assigned a physical location.) This is useful for us as the project progresses, because if we better remember the risks and opportunities at play, we are more likely to tailor our behavior and everyday decisions toward them appropriately.


  Finding and categorizing risks is a start, but not sufficient. The real value comes from converting them into actionable stories for the prioritized backlog. Then tracking and adapting based on review and reflection of the systems effectiveness.
