whatIs: The “Quantitative Risk Analysis” process attempts to quantify (put some
  numbers against) risks under consideration.
whyDo: It helps understand the magnitude of individual risks and then, viewed
  together, the overall project risk profile.

  Before quantifying risks, let's talk about the dangers of applying math to
  estimates and speculations.


  As Albert Einstein said, “Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted.” In other words, some of the things we can quantify are not that useful, and some of the things we would like to quantify cannot easily be measured. Also, some research claims that quantitative risk approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventive measures.


  However, as long as we are aware that trying to quantify risks may be problematic, we can still gain some valuable insights into their likely importance that can help us with prioritization. The usual way of quantifying risks is to express the impact of the risk occurring in monetary terms and the probability of it occurring as a percentage. We can then calculate the Expected Monetary Value of our risks.


  For example, in a software project we may have a risk that our in-house reporting engine may not be up to the performance needs of the project. If the cost of swapping it out was US$80,000 and we thought it 50% likely that we would need a replacement reporting engine, then we could calculate the Expected Monetary Value of the risk as:


  Expected Monetary Value = Impact (US$80,000) x Probability (50%) = US$40,000


  Calculating the Expected Monetary Values of our risks then allows us to prioritize them. The general idea is that, much like an agile project's prioritized backlog of features, we want to tackle them (find ways to avoid the risk or make it smaller) in that order to minimize risks to the project as soon as possible.


  The team games we use in this step are more to socialize the risk management concepts with the team to better illustrate why backlog items may shift, than taking action. That comes in the next step (risk response planning), which is all about deciding what to do about the risks and putting work in our project backlog of things to do. For now, we are just concerned with quantifying the risks.


  Shark’s Tank


  Agile has the concept of the “next-best dollar spent” that reminds us to always be looking where we can add the most value next. This may be in developing a new feature from the backlog that will generate an increment of Return on Investment (ROI) once it is released to the business; or it may be to invest some time in avoiding or reducing a risk that threatens to negatively impact the project through expensive rework, delays, or additional costs.


  The popular TV show “Shark Tank” in which entrepreneurs pitch investment proposals to investors, can be a useful metaphor for modeling the next-best dollar spent. By comparing features from the backlog with risks to mitigate, we can get the team more comfortable with the seemingly shifting priorities that may come from the product owner or business representative when they consider the next-best dollar spent and prioritize the backlog accordingly.
